[BL4] input for percentage of liquids

[BL4] input for tare

[BL4] while testing, make a field for manual inputs

[] handling of real data from weight module

[?] *probably* add density input for 2 liquids <- i suppose we can have these as fixed values / drop-down lists

[] figure out how this eNode works

[BL4] add output fields for how many g (or ml) we have 

[BL4] output fields for telling if we should pour more, poured right enough, poured too much, so we have to increase mass of other part to maintain percentage

[?] *maybe* knowing "soda" percentage of liquids calculate amount of C2H5OH in resulting liquid

[?] *probably* button for simulating some kind of pump, which pours liquids in. for pump we need different window to set up:
speed (g(ml)/s)
some other things(think about it)
button for manual pouring

[TKC] Normal tutorials

UPD:
• Text holo effect (random moving across time with certain chance and delay) [TKC & BL4] [cancelled]
• Mode for compounds of 2 things, knowing desired mass of mix and proportions [BL4]
• Some kind of sales mode:
	price of thing
	price of boxing and shipping
	checking if we keep within limits
