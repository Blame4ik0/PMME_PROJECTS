// I propose to divide tasks by putting:
// • [TKC]
// • [your surname shortened]

// for example: 
// [TKC] while testing, make a field for manual inputs

// [?] means that i have a proposal/question/comment regarding the task



══════════ (x) Not started ══════════
[] input for percentage of liquids

[] input for tare

[] while testing, make a field for manual inputs

[] handling of real data from weight module

[?] *probably* add density input for 2 liquids <- i suppose we can have these as fixed values / drop-down lists

[] figure out how this eNode works

[] add output fields for how many g (or ml) we have 

[] output fields for telling if we should pour more, poured right enough, poured too much, so we have to increase mass of other part to maintain percentage

[] *maybe* knowing "soda" percentage of liquids calculate amount of C2H5OH in resulting liquid

[] *probably* button for simulating some kind of pump, which pours liquids in. for pump we need different window to set up:
speed (g(ml)/s)
some other things(think about it)
button for manual pouring

*maybe* warning after you drink too much

[] *MAYBE* button to pass car keys <- not a "maybe" (¬‿¬) 
// But if seriously, i suppose we should design it in a way that it can be used for both *interesting* purposes, and practical tasks. 
// We have to keep in mind that our projects might be shown to [Гуменюк/Скляр/Любомир].
// And i suppose they wont really tolerate such thingies... especially if we will ask them to get a bonus mark for this project. 
// Maybe we can present it as some kind of chemistry calculator?


══════════ (→) In progress ══════════


══════════ (✓) Completed ══════════


// Regarding UI and anims
// theoretically speaking, we can use an ascii artstyle...? (like in a fancy linux terminal)
// for instance a progress bar like this one: https://github.com/superjojo140/ascii-bar?tab=readme-ov-file
// though i am not really sure.
