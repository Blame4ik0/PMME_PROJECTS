we have to do:
cool ui

handling of real data from weight module

while testing, make a field for manual inputs

input for percentage of liquids

*probably* add density input for 2 liquids

figure out how this eNode works

add output fields for how many g (or ml) we have

output fields for telling if we should pour more, poured right enough, poured too much, so we have to increase mass of other part to maintain percentage

*probably* button for simulating some kind of pump, which pours liquids in. for pump we need different window to set up:
speed (g(ml)/s)
some other things(think about it)
button for manual pouring

*maybe* knowing "soda" percentage of liquids calculate amount of C2H5OH in resulting liquid
*maybe* some funny anims
*maybe* warning after you drink too much
*MAYBE* button to pass car keys
