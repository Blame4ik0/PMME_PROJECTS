══════════ (x) Not started ══════════

[✓] handling of real data from weight module

[✓] ***probably* add density input for 2 liquids <- i suppose we can have these as fixed values / drop-down lists** this was implemented in other way

[✓] figure out how this eNode works

[BL4] add output fields for how many g (or ml) we have 

[#] *maybe* knowing "soda" percentage of liquids calculate amount of C2H5OH in resulting liquid

[#] *probably* button for simulating some kind of pump, which pours liquids in. for pump we need different window to set up:
speed (g(ml)/s)
some other things(think about it)
button for manual pouring

[TKC] Normal tutorials

══════════ (→) In progress ══════════

══════════ (#) Denied idea ══════════

══════════ (✓) Completed ══════════


UPD:
• Text holo effect (random moving across time with certain chance and delay) [TKC]
• Mode for compounds of 2 things, knowing desired mass of mix and proportions [✓]

!!!!!
[TKC] in compounds mode add a place for 3 buttons (tare zero ptare) and add them. and also add field which shows current net weight [TKC]
!!!!!
